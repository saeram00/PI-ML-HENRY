# PI-ML-HENRY

Individual project related to Machine Learning

#### Link to data files folder: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PftPdEGvb-byhq2BYr1cB5KJQcmJhZeW?usp=sharing)

Inside the data folder you'll find 2 gzipped tar files: raw_data.tgz and processed_data.tgz. The first, "raw", contains a data folder with the datasets provided by HENRY for the project before any transformations were applied to them, while the second, "processed", is the result of all the ETL operations contained in ETL/etl.ipynb applied to the raw csv files, resulting in 2 simple csv files: movies_db.csv and processed_ratings.csv, both of which were used throughout the rest of the project.

The setup.sh script provided in this repo should allow you to download either or both of them at your discretion.
